### Description
This project is a utility web application for tracking your expenses -- a virtual checkbook register, if you will. It provides simple functionality for adding transactions for funds in or funds out. It's also an installable progressive web app that works offline so that you can add your transactions whenever necessary and know that your balance will be accurate at all times -- even if you give Bigfoot a ten-spot while in the middle of nowhere, far from any sort of network connectivity.

### Additional notes / coming soon
- Currently, the offline functionality only appears to work if the connection is lost while the app is open. If you open the app while already offline and attempt to add a transaction, the POST is not successful for some reason - this will be resolved soon.
- Functionality for filtering the transactions list & chart to the most recent week/month/year will be coming soon as well
- A styling update is coming soon for the transaction list to make it clearer at a glance which transactions are funds added and which are funds subtracted
